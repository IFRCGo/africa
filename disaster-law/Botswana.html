          <p> The Disaster Risk Management Plan provides that the Botswana Red Cross Society is a primary agency in respect of disaster management activities in Botswana which relate to mass care of those affected by disasters and the provision of basic needs critical to the survival of those affected by a disaster; and a support agency in respect of activities related to information dissemination and the media, resource support, public health and mental health. The role of the National Society in respect of disaster relief and international disaster assistance is also provided in the National Disaster Risk Management Plan, which provides that depending on the severity of the disaster, international assistance for disaster relief may be requested by the National Emergency Coordinator or the Botswana Red Cross Society after an official appeal for international assistance is made, based on identified needs that cannot be met nationally.</p>
          <p> However, the Red Cross Society of Botswana Act does not contain specific facilities for the National Society relating to disaster preparedness and response. The National Society should be contacted directly to determine whether any legal facilities are enjoyed in the country by virtue of the auxiliary role or in terms of arrangements made in terms of customs and taxation laws. </p>

      <div >
        <div class="card-section">
          <p><font > <u> <b>General </b> </u> <br> </font> The Disaster Risk Management framework in Botswana contains limited provisions on legal facilities for international assisting actors in disaster situations. The National Disaster Risk Management Plan provides that the Ministry of Trade and Industry is responsible for collaborating with the Ministry of Finance and the Office of the President in providing rebate certificates and import permits for goods intended for relief purposes; and the Ministry of Finance and Development planning is responsible for facilitating the entry of all official disaster assistance commodities, as well as waiving customs and duty where appropriate.
          </p>
          <p ><font > <u> <b>Customs and Exercise </b></u> <br> </font> Customs in Botswana is regulated by the Customs Act, 2018 which provides the procedure for the entry of goods into the country. Under section 96 of the Customs Act, all goods imported into or exported from Botswana, including relief consignments, must be declared to the Revenue Service and placed under a customs procedure. A special procedure in respect of relief goods is provided for by section 258 of the Customs Act, in terms of which the Revenue Service shall grant clearance of a relief consignment without regard to the country of origin or country of destination, provided the relief consignment is authorized by:<ul>
         <li> <i>1. Lodging of a customs declaration or of a provisional or incomplete customs declaration subject to completion of the declaration within a specified period;</i>  </li>
         <li> <i>2. Lodging, registering, and checking of a customs declaration and supporting documents prior to the arrival of the goods, and their release upon arrival;</i>  </li>
         <li> <i>3. Clearance outside the designated hours of business or away from customs offices and the waiver of any charges in this respect; </i> </li>
         <li> <i>4. Examination or sampling of goods only in exceptional circumstances.  </i> </li>

         </ul>
         In addition, in terms of the Customs and Excise Tariff (Item 412.11), goods imported:
         <ul>
         <li> <i>1. For the relief of distress of persons in cases of famine or other national disaster; </i>  </li>
         <li> <i>2.	Under any technical assistance agreement;. </i>    </li>
         <li> <i>3.	In terms of an obligation under any multilateral international agreement to which Botswana is a party;. </i>    </li>
         </ul>
          May be imported under a full rebate of customs duties provided that:  </p>
          <ul>
          <li> <i>1. A certificate is issued by the International Trade Administration Commission and any other conditions as may be agreed upon by the Governments of South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, and Namibia are complied with </i>  </li>
          <li> <i>2. The goods imported shall not be sold or disposed of to any party who is not entitled to any privileges under the rebate item, or be removed to the area of Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, or Namibia without the permission of the International Trade Administration Commission </i>    </li>
          </ul>
          In addition, relief consignments received as gifts by an approved organisation for use or distribution by or under the control of such organisation, may be admitted free of duties and taxes in terms of section 258 of the Customs Act. However, the term “approved organisation” is not defined and therefore it is not clear which organisations may benefit from this provision.
          <p><font > <u> <b>Taxation </b> </u> <br> </font> The Third Schedule of the <a href="https://botswanalaws.com/alphabetical-list-of-statutes/value-added-tax#Ch5003s10">Value Added Tax Act</a> provides that the importation of donations and goods for the relief of distress of persons in cases of famine or other national disaster are exempt from VAT. In addition, the relevant Minister may authorize the granting of a refund of tax paid or borne on a supply to, or import by, an organisation or government to the extent provided under a technical assistance or humanitarian assistance agreement entered into between the Government of Botswana and any organisation or government of any country.</p><p> Although international disaster assistance is not explicitly mentioned, the <a href="https://botswanalaws.com/alphabetical-list-of-statutes/income-tax#SubLCh52:01_Sch2_PartII">Income Tax Act</a> exempts certain individuals and entities from income tax and provides that the Minister may also enter into taxation agreements with persons to exempt such persons from tax. Although not directly related to international disaster assistance, certain assisting actors may fall within these categories, or may apply for exemption from taxation, should they meet the criteria required in these provisions.
