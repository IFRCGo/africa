However, information relating to legal facilities available to the Congolese Red Cross could not be found in the Congolese domestic laws available for review for the purposes of this research.</p> <p>In terms of sub-regional instruments, the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) <a href="https://www.vertic.org/media/National Legislation/Chad/Code_Douanes_CEMAC.pdf">Customs Code</a>, however, provides in article 276 that importation free of duties and taxes may be authorized in favor of, among others, consignments intended for the Red Cross, and that goods exported by the Red Cross can also be exempt from exit duties and taxes.

            The Congo subscribes to the monist approach to international law, according to which international agreements automatically become part of domestic law as soon as they are ratified and published.

          </p><p>The Congo is a party to the <a href="https://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_cons.pdf">Convention on International Civil Aviation</a>, <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/498">Annex 9</a> of which provides procedural guidance for the clearance of aircrafts containing humanitarian assistance in response to disasters, including passengers, goods, and equipment. This may facilitate the entry of international disaster assistance in the Congo. Domestic laws pertaining to aviation and customs could not be found online.
            </p><p>

            The Congo is also a party to the <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/1602">International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures </a>(Kyoto Convention) and has acceded to all of the annexes thereto, including Annexe B3 of the Kyoto Convention, which recommends as practice that states exempt from import duties and taxes and from economic prohibitions and restrictions goods, including “foodstuffs, medicaments, clothing and blankets sent as gifts to an approved charitable or philanthropic organisation for distribution free of charge to needy persons by the organisation or under its control”. In addition, Annexe J5 provides guidelines to expedite the clearance of relief consignments intended to assist those affected by disasters. “Relief consignments” are defined to mean:
            “goods, including vehicles and other means of transport, foodstuffs, medicaments, clothing, blankets, tents, prefabricated houses, water purifying and water storage items, or other goods of prime necessity, forwarded as aid to those affected by disaster; and all equipment, vehicles and other means of transport, specially trained animals, provisions, supplies, personal effects and other goods for disaster relief personnel in order to perform their duties and to support them in living and working in the territory of the disaster throughout the duration of their mission.” These provisions may facilitate the expedited entry of relief consignments, including food, medication, and specialized equipment such as vehicles and communications equipment, into the Congo.
            </p>

            <p>
            In terms of sub-regional instruments, although international disaster assistance is not explicitly mentioned, the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) <a href="https://www.vertic.org/media/National Legislation/Chad/Code_Douanes_CEMAC.pdf">Customs Code</a> provides in article 276 that importation free of duties and taxes may be authorized in favour of;
            <br>
           <i>
            a) Donations offered to Heads of State.
            b)	Materials and products provided free of charge to Member States by foreign States or international organizations;<br>
            c)	Items intended for Ambassadors, diplomatic and consular services and foreign members of certain official international organizations based in Member States;<br>
            d)	Consignments intended for the Red Cross and other national solidarity organizations specially designated, devoid of any commercial character of certain materials and products, either by reason of their method of financing, or by reason of their nature or their destination.<br>
