            <p> <font > <u> <b>Landing rights and general customs arrangements </b> </u> <br> </font>In terms of international law, Cameroon subscribes to the monist approach to international law, according to which international agreements automatically become part of domestic law as soon as they are ratified and officially published. Cameroon is a State party to the <a href="https://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_cons.pdf">Convention in International Civil Aviation of 1944</a>, which includes, in <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/498">Annex 9</a> , procedural guidance for customs, immigration, agriculture, and public health clearance of aircrafts containing humanitarian assistance in response to disasters, including passengers, goods, and mail. Cameroon is also a party to the <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/1221">Convention on the Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic</a> which mandates parties to facilitate the entry and exit of vessels engaged in natural disaster relief work and facilitate the entry of persons and cargo related to natural disaster relief work. This may facilitate the entry of international disaster assistance in Cameroon.
            </p><p>
            Cameroon is also a party to the <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/1602">International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonisation of Customs Procedures (Kyoto Convention)</a>, and its annexes, which simplify and harmonize customs clearance procedures for the importation of goods. Annex B3 recommends as practice that states exempt from import duties and taxes and from economic prohibitions and restrictions goods, including “foodstuffs, medicaments, clothing and blankets sent as gifts to an approved charitable or philanthropic organisation for distribution free of charge to needy persons by the organization or under its control”, and Annex J5 provides guidelines to expedite the clearance of relief consignments intended to assist those affected by disasters. “Relief consignments” are defined to mean: “goods, including vehicles and other means of transport, foodstuffs, medicaments, clothing, blankets, tents, prefabricated houses, water purifying and water storage items, or other goods of prime necessity, forwarded as aid to those affected by disaster; and all equipment, vehicles and other means of transport, specially trained animals, provisions, supplies, personal effects and other goods for disaster relief personnel in order to perform their duties and to support them in living and working in the territory of the disaster throughout the duration of their mission”. These provisions may facilitate the expedited entry of relief consignments, including food, medication, and specialized equipment such as vehicles and communications equipment, into Cameroon.
          </p><p>

           In terms of sub-regional instruments, although international disaster assistance is not explicitly mentioned, the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) <a href="https://www.vertic.org/media/National Legislation/Chad/Code_Douanes_CEMAC.pdf">Customs Code</a> provides in article 276 that importation free of duties and taxes may be authorized in favour of:
         </p><p>
   <ul>
     <li>
  a)	Donations offered to Heads of State;</li><li>
  b)	Materials and products provided free of charge to Member States by foreign States or international organizations;></li><li>
  c)	Items intended for Ambassadors, diplomatic and consular services and foreign members of certain official international organizations based in Member States;</li><li>
  d)	Consignments intended for the Red Cross and other national solidarity organizations specially designated, devoid of any commercial character of certain materials and products, either by reason of their method of financing, or by reason of their nature or their destination.
</li>
</ul>
 </p><p>

        In terms of domestic law, the <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/3343?language_content_entity=en">General Tax Code</a> lists of types of entities exempted from the corporate income tax in article 4, but international disaster assistance is not specifically mentioned. However, the General Tax Code does state that the net taxable profit of an entity is established after deduction of all expenses directly required by the exercise of the taxable activity in Cameroon, including donations made on the occasion of disasters, deductible in the forms and conditions laid down by order of the Minister of Finance. In addition, the General Tax Code does make provision for international organisations to benefit from a wide range of tax exemptions in terms of headquarters agreements entered into between the organisation and the Government of Cameroon.
