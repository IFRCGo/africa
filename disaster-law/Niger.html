            <p> <font > <u> <b>Landing rights and general customs arrangements </b> </u> <br> </font> In terms of international law, Niger subscribes to the monist approach to international law, according to which international agreements automatically become part of domestic law as soon as they are ratified and officially published in the national gazette. Niger is a State party to the <a href="https://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_cons.pdf">Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention)</a>, which includes, in <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/498">Annex 9</a>, procedural guidance for customs, immigration, agriculture, and public health clearance of aircrafts containing humanitarian assistance in response to disasters, including passengers, goods, and mail.
              </p><p>
            Niger is also a party to the <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/1602">International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (Kyoto Convention)</a>, and its annexes, which simplify and harmonize customs clearance procedures for the importation of goods. Annex B3 recommends as practice that states exempt from import duties and taxes and from economic prohibitions and restrictions, goods including “foodstuffs, medicaments, clothing and blankets sent as gifts to an approved charitable or philanthropic organization for distribution free of charge to needy persons by the organization or under its control”, and Annex J5 provides guidelines to expedite the clearance of relief consignments intended to assist those affected by disasters, therefore apply in the country. “Relief consignments” are defined to include: “goods, including vehicles and other means of transport, foodstuffs, medicaments, clothing, blankets, tents, prefabricated houses, water purifying and water storage items, or other goods of prime necessity, forwarded as aid to those affected by disaster; and all equipment, vehicles and other means of transport, specially trained animals, provisions, supplies, personal effects and other goods for disaster relief personnel in order to perform their duties and to support them in living and working in the territory of the disaster throughout the duration of their mission.”
          </p><p>

            Niger is a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Chapter 3 of the <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/3332?language_content_entity=en">ECOWAS Customs Code</a> contains provisions related to relief consignments, providing that clearance of relief consignments for export, transit, temporary admission and import shall be carried out as a matter of priority. Furthermore, in the case of relief consignments, customs shall provide for: a) lodging of a simplified goods declaration or of a provisional or incomplete goods declaration subject to completion of the declaration within a specified period; b) lodging and registering or checking of the goods declaration and supporting documents prior to the arrival of the goods, and their release upon arrival; c) clearance outside the designated hours of business or away from customs offices and the waiver of any charges in this respect; and d) examination and/or sampling of goods only in exceptional circumstances.
          </p><p>
            Lastly, the chapter provides that clearance of relief consignments should be granted without regard to the country of origin, the country from which the goods arrived, or country of destination. In the case of relief consignments, any economic export prohibitions or restrictions and any export duties or taxes otherwise payable should be waived. Relief consignments received as gifts by approved organizations for use by or under the control of such organizations, or for distribution free of charge by them or under their control, should be admitted free of import duties and taxes and free of economic import prohibitions or restrictions.
          </p><p>

          Niger is also a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA). In terms of Article 2 of <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/3333?language_content_entity=fr">Regulation 09/2008/CN/UEMOA</a>, which establishes simplified procedures for customs clearance, Member States may grant simplified procedures to certain goods for reasons related to urgency or any other duly justified reason. Although this regulation does not specify which goods or equipment could be subject to these provisions, it could potentially include international relief goods and equipment of urgent nature. Article 3 provides the requirements for simplified customs procedures, stating that it must contain, where applicable, the following information:

          </p>
          <p>

          •	Name or company name of the importer<br>
         •	Full address of the importe. <br>
         •  Number of the fiscal identifier;<br>
         •	Total number in figures and letters of the articles covered by the declaration;<br>
         •	Total number of packages in a shipment;<br>
         •	Description of goods;<br>
         •	Name and code of country of origin;<br>
         •	Identification of the means of transport;<br>
         •	Mentions of the attached documents;<br>
         •	Gross and net weight of the goods;<br>
         •	Customs value of the goods in figures and letters;<br>
         •	Rate and amount to be collected for import duties; and<br>
         •	Name, address, company name, approval number of declarants, date and signature.<br>

       </p><p>

         These provisions may facilitate the expedited entry of relief consignments, including food, medication, and specialized equipment such as vehicles and communications equipment, into Niger.
         Limited relevant domestic laws were accessible online for the purposes of this review. However, <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/3334?language_content_entity=fr">Decree 92-292</a> provides in article 14 that the Nigerien government is committed to:
       </p><p>
       <br>• Exempting NGOs (national and international) of all customs duties, all taxes and indirect taxes, including VAT, on supplies, equipment, material and donations in kind imported into Niger within the framework of the execution of projects or assistance programs in which it participates;
       <br>•	Applying NGOs temporary importation regime to service vehicles without any obligation on the part of the NGO to pay a deposit to the customs service following their purchase;
        <br>•	Exempting NGOs from all customs duties, all taxes and direct taxes, including VAT, on all equipment and products acquired by the NGO in the course of its activities; and
        <br>•	Exempting any contract, market or act of any kind signed for the execution of projects, payment of stamp registration fees, turnover tax and VAT.</li>
      </ul>

      </p><p>

        In addition, <a href="https://disasterlaw.ifrc.org/media/3335?language_content_entity=fr">Law 2020-067</a> establishes the Finances Law for 2021 in Niger, providing new additions and amendments to the General Tax Code. Article 23 provides that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and Development Associations are exempted from all taxes and indirect taxes within the framework of actions directly contributing to the realization of their projects, including a VAT exemption on services.
        However, it could not be confirmed whether these facilities/exemptions are applicable automatically, or whether NGOs need to apply to access these exemptions.

          </p>
