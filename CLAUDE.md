# Working in this repository

The Community Centered Humanitarian Analysis Platform: a Django + PostGIS
application that reads humanitarian documents and APIs into a database and draws
the result on a MapLibre dashboard.

Everything runs in Docker. There is no Django environment on the host:

    docker compose exec web python manage.py <command>
    docker compose exec web python manage.py test <app> -v 2

## The two jobs an agent does here

### 1. Pull external data

**For a person, the route in is Admin → Data Refresh via API → Data
sources**, at `/admin/api_calls/datasource/`. Each row carries its last pull
and its newest data date, and every
API-backed row has a **Pull now** button that fetches, saves the raw response
under `data_pipeline/api_cache/`, and loads it. Rebuilding the dashboard
afterwards is a **separate** button on that page, so the database and the map
move only when you say so.

**The two Excel rows have a button too, labelled Reload file**, because their
newer data arrives as a saved workbook rather than an API response. It runs
`load_workbooks --only <variant>` against the file under `/work` — so it picks up
whatever has been *saved*, and `--only` is what keeps one row's press to one
workbook. The label differs from "Pull now" on purpose: nothing is fetched, and a
row that said "Pull now" would invite the reading that the platform goes looking
for figures the file does not yet contain.

**A workbook row's staleness is its sha1, not its date.** "Pull everything out of
date" skips anything already pulled today, which is right for an API and wrong for
a file: an analyst who saves a corrected figure an hour after the morning load
would be told there is nothing to do. `load_workbooks.file_changed()` compares the
fingerprint already held in `params`, and `api_calls/views.stale_rows()` uses it for
`FILE_SOURCES` instead of the date rule.

**One function decides which command refreshes a row**: `api_calls/views.refresh_argv()`.
The button, the confirmation view and `pull_batch` all ask it, and it returns a
positional argv that both `subprocess.Popen` and `call_command` accept. A second
rule anywhere else is how an excel row admitted by `stale_rows()` starts failing
inside every batch while its own button works.

`kobo` and `acaps` still have no button — they take different inputs
(`load_hsps`, a CSV export path) and the list names the command for each.

**`dtm` is the first source whose payload is not JSON.** The HDX resources
behind `sudan-displacement-situation-countrywide-idps-iom-dtm` are `.xlsx`
workbooks, so `Call.format="xlsx"` sends them through
`external_data/fetchers/workbook.py`, which transcribes **any** workbook to
`{"sheets": {name: [[cell, …], …]}}` and saves the raw bytes beside the JSON —
a transcription is not the response, and the bytes are what settles an argument
about whether the parser or the publisher was wrong. The transcriber knows
nothing about DTM; every scrap of that lives in `loaders/dtm_snapshot.py`, which
anchors on **HXL tags** because sheet names and header offsets drift between
snapshots — and because snapshot 004's IDP sheets are titled "Return Master
List". Its watermark is `known_ids` (resource ids), not a date: DTM publishes
each snapshot as a new resource. A first pull that finds no snapshot resources
raises rather than reporting "up to date".

**DTM's IDP totals sit BESIDE the HAPI series, not over it.** `hdx/idps` runs
from Aug 2023 and the snapshots from Nov 2025; they are the same programme
counted on different dates, and `date` is in `uniq_movement_observation`, so
sharing a `source` would add rows rather than merge them and inflate the IDP
bubbles. The snapshots are `source='dtm'`, and `build_idp_localities()` still
filters `source='hdx'`.

**The matrix is its own table.** `displacement_breakdown` holds one row per
cell — of the people at this place on this date, how many came from there —
keyed `(dimension, key)` where `key` is a state p-code or `OUTSIDE_SDN`.
Household counts ride here as `dimension='households'` because
`uniq_movement_observation` has no `unit`, so an individuals row and a
households row for one locality and date would overwrite each other.
`build_returnee_localities()` draws **admin2 only** — DTM publishes a state
total *and* the localities inside it, and drawing both puts Khartoum's 2.5m
bubble on top of the localities it is the sum of. Design:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-dtm-displacement-snapshots-design.md`.

From a terminal, the same thing, and this is what the button runs:

    docker compose exec web python manage.py refresh_external <source> <dataset> --iso3 <ISO3>

Those buttons call the upstream APIs **directly**, because the container cannot
run the MCP servers: they are Node scripts on a host share that is not mounted
into it. The payloads are identical — every MCP tool this project uses is a
pass-through wrapper ending in `return response.data` — but the distinction
matters the day a fetcher and its tool disagree. Fetchers live in
`external_data/fetchers/`, mirroring `loaders/`; each records the tool it
reproduces. `IPC_API_KEY` and `HDX_API_TOKEN` go in `.env` (the HDX one also
covers the `unhcr` rows); FEWS NET needs no key. Design:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-mcp-data-sources-admin-design.md`.

**IPC pulls are filtered, and not only by what is held.** `known_ids` says what
loaded; `skipped_ids` says what a person deliberately excluded, plus anything
that came back empty. Without the second list a refresh re-pulls every
exclusion — Chad's March 2024 displaced-population analysis among them — and
retries the known-empty analyses forever.

**The app is `api_calls` throughout** - package, label, URL and heading. It was
`mcp` until 2026-09-24, renamed because nothing here speaks the Model Context
Protocol; the pulls are plain HTTPS. Imports read `from api_calls.models import
...`. The table is `api_pull_job` (pinned in `Meta.db_table`) and job logs land in
`api_cache/api/`. **Both were renamed by migrations, not by hand**, because
`PullJob.log_path` and `Conversion.markdown_path` hold ABSOLUTE paths into the
cache: `api_calls/0003` and `insights/0009` rewrite them, and moving that folder
again without extending those two is how a job page starts showing an empty log
with nothing raised. Renaming a
label again means updating `django_migrations.app` and
`django_content_type.app_label` by hand; no migration can do it, and
MAINTENANCE.md §6 has the two statements.

`.mcp.json` in this folder configures five humanitarian MCP servers — `hdx`,
`fewsnet`, `ifrc-go`, `unhcr-refugees`, `ipc`. Claude Code reads it
automatically; nothing else needs configuring.

**For an agent, and for the sources with no fetcher** (`kobo`, `acaps`), the rule
is unchanged — **fetch, save, then load**, never fetch straight into the database:

1. Check what is already held: `manage.py external_status`.
2. Call the MCP tool for what is missing or newer.
3. Save the raw response under `data_pipeline/api_cache/`.
4. Load it: `manage.py load_external <dataset> <path> --iso3 <ISO3>`.

Loaders live in `external_data/loaders/`; `external_data/loaders/base.py` states
the four guarantees each one keeps.

**Never pull two IPC countries in parallel.** Recorded incident: the connection
closed and the server stayed down for the rest of the session.

### 2. Extract community insights from documents

Read `insights/prompts/extract_insights.md` and follow it exactly. That file is
the single source of truth for the extraction and its output format; this section
does not restate it.

The route in for a person is **Admin → Community insights → Part 1 — Documents →
insights**: pick files or a folder from a native window on your own machine,
**read them** (step 2, below), extract (watchable, and it survives the tab
closing), then review and publish. Part 2 is the statement table, for typing one
in by hand and for deciding the ones still pending.

**Part 2 lists everything except published; Part 3 lists nothing else.** Parts 1
and 2 are for actions, so a decision already taken leaves the queue —
`InsightAdmin.get_queryset()` excludes `published`, and the `PublishedInsight`
proxy (`Part 3 — Published insights`) is where they are read, whole and
view-only. Read-only because the quote on a published row was matched against
the page text it came from and an edit would invalidate that check silently; the
way back is the **Un-publish** action, which returns a row to `pending` and
clears the reviewer stamp so Part 2 picks it up. It does not restore the source
file — retention released that at publication, and nothing undoes a delete.

**Documents are read with Docling before the model sees them.** Step 2, "Read
these documents", converts each PDF or Word file to per-page markdown — reading
order, tables and headings kept, scanned pages OCR'd — and **replaces** the
PyMuPDF text intake wrote. That replacement is the point: `verify.py` re-matches
every quote against the same `DocumentText` rows the model read, so the two must
never diverge. Terminal equivalent, and what the button runs:

    docker compose exec web python manage.py convert_documents --job <N>

Three things about it that are not guessable:

- **A document Docling cannot read keeps its intake text** and is badged "Docling
  failed" on the preview. A re-read always tries Docling again first — the
  fallback is never sticky.
- **A document that already has a non-rejected insight is refused.** Moving the
  page text under a quote that was verified against it would invalidate that
  check with nothing left to say so. The practical cost: a batch already
  extracted from PyMuPDF text cannot be upgraded without rejecting its pending
  queue first.
- **OCR languages are not a free combination.** EasyOCR will not load Arabic
  beside any other non-English language, and one pass has one language list, so
  `DOCLING_OCR_LANGS` is `en,ar` or `en,fr`, not both. Both sets of weights are
  in the image; switching is a `.env` edit and a restart.

`ExtractionJob.status` reads `collecting → collected → converting → converted →
queued → running → loaded`. **`queued` means converted and ready to extract**,
not "files are in".

**An uploaded document is not kept.** What the platform keeps is the text read
out of it and the statements published from it, so `insights/retention.py`
deletes the file under `media/insights/` as soon as the document has no pending
statement left, and sweeps anything older than
`INSIGHT_UPLOAD_RETENTION_MINUTES` (default 30) whether it was reviewed or not.
Releasing blanks `InsightUpload.file` and touches nothing else - the `Document`,
its `DocumentText` pages and every `Insight` stay. There is no scheduler here,
so the sweep runs on wizard page loads and from `manage.py prune_uploads`; a
batch at `converting` is skipped until Docling finishes with it. Re-importing a
released file stores the bytes again and **moves that document's still-pending
statements to the new batch**, so the review queue follows the person rather
than being extracted a second time.

**Retention follows rows, never the folder.** Nothing deletes a file because
the database does not mention it - a file left behind by deleting an upload in
Admin stays until a person removes it. An earlier version swept those from the
wizard's page load and `manage.py test` emptied this deployment's upload
folder, because the test database legitimately has no rows in it.

**A batch whose files were swept refuses to be read**, rather than badging
every document "Docling failed" and quietly extracting from the weaker intake
text: step 2 says the files were released and links to a new import.
`retention.released_documents(job)` is the check, and a document already read
successfully is not in it. The rule is not fussiness: "no row claims it" is only as true as the
database being asked, and asked against an empty one - a test run, a restored
dump - the answer is every file in the folder. An earlier version swept
unclaimed files from the wizard's page load, and `manage.py test` emptied this
deployment's upload folder.

An archive already sitting on a mounted share should be registered as an
`InsightFolder` instead — nothing is copied that way. Which folders may be
browsed is `INSIGHT_DOCUMENT_ROOTS`; there is no hardcoded `/work` any more, and
the host folder behind the mount is `SOURCE_HOST_DIR`.

## Things worth knowing before changing anything

- `/work` is mounted **read-only**. Anything written goes under `/app`.
- **`web` runs gunicorn, which never autoreloads. After a model change, run
  `docker compose restart web`** — migrating alone is not enough. The symptom is
  not a stale page: `AddField` sets a DB default only to backfill it and then
  drops it, so a worker that booted before the field existed omits the column
  from its INSERT and the next request raises
  `NotNullViolation: null value in column "<field>"`. `manage.py test` forks a
  fresh process, so the whole suite stays green while the running site is broken.
- `data_pipeline/steps/s03_parse.py` deletes and rebuilds `population_figures`,
  `movement_flows` and `narrative_tags` on every run, and `s04_events.py` deletes
  every row in `events`. Do not put hand-curated data in those tables.
- The `insights` app is never written to by any pipeline step. That is deliberate.
- Settings use `os.environ.get(X, default)` by default; use `get(X) or default` (or `env_path()`) only when an empty .env value must fall back to the default instead of being treated as empty.
- Specs are in `docs/superpowers/specs/`, plans in `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
