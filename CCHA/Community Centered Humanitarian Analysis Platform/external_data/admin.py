"""The external-source tables at /admin/, so they can be browsed without SQL.

Alongside what data_track and boundaries register. Without this file the admin
showed ten of the project's sixteen tables: the seven read out of the UNHCR
PDFs and the three that make up the map. The six below - the ones pulled from IPC,
FEWS NET, ACAPS, HDX, UNHCR and Kobo - existed in the database and were invisible
from the browser.

Read-only, for the same reason boundaries is. Almost every one of these tables is
written by a loader (`seed_external`, `load_hsps`, `load_workbooks`,
`loaders/base`), so a row hand-edited here is a row the next refresh silently
overwrites. The way to change a phase or a crossing's coordinates is to fix the
source and re-run the loader, not to leave the database disagreeing with the
thing that fills it.

PlaceCoordinate IS THE EXCEPTION, AND BY THE SAME RULE. No loader writes it -
it is a person's answer to "where is this place, since no polygon knows", and
load_hsps only reads it. There is nothing here for a refresh to overwrite, so the
reason for read-only does not apply, and making it read-only would leave the one
table on this page that is meant to be typed into uneditable. (`seed_external`
uses get_or_create on it, so re-seeding cannot undo an edit made here either.)
