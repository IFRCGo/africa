"""Picking a place out of the boundary library instead of typing one.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The Insight admin form used to ask a reviewer to type
`iso3`, and then to type `admin_pcode`, `admin_level`, `match_method`, `lat` and
`lon` beside it. Those last five are not answers a person has - they are what a
successful match PRODUCES. Typing a p-code by hand is how an insight lands on
the wrong polygon, and typing a latitude by hand is how one lands in the sea.

So the reviewer answers the question they can actually answer - which country,
which state, which district - and this module derives the rest from the polygon
they picked, exactly as `insights.places.resolve()` derives it from a name. The
two routes in must agree; a hand-keyed insight and an extracted one are the same
kind of record, and insights/admin.py says so at the top.

THE DEEPEST SELECTION WINS. District beats state beats country, because a
district is a better answer to "where are these people" than the state
containing it. What is NOT derived from the dropdown is the level: that is read
off the AdminArea row itself. See `InsightPlaceForm.save` for why that matters more
than it sounds.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT TOUCHED. `place_name_as_written` stays the source's own
spelling. A document saying "Wad Medani" keeps saying "Wad Medani" even when the
polygon it matched is spelled "Wad Madani Al Kubra" - the two columns answer
different questions and collapsing them would lose the source's voice.
