"""Serving the boundary library to the map, and to anything else that asks.

    /api/boundaries/layers/                    what maps do we have?
    /api/boundaries/layer/?iso3=ETH&level=2    one whole level, as GeoJSON
    /api/boundaries/features/?ids=SD01,ET0101  exactly these polygons

The dashboard uses the third one almost exclusively. It works out which places
this month's reporting names, asks for those p-codes, and draws what comes
back - so what crosses the network is proportional to what is on the screen,
about a hundred polygons, rather than to how deep the library goes. That is
what makes ADM4 free until something is actually reported at ADM4.

The first two exist for everything else: the layer catalogue is the answer to
"do we already have Chad's districts?", and the layer endpoint hands them over.

RESPONSES ARE STREAMED. A whole level can be five thousand polygons, and
building that into one string in memory before sending a byte of it would be
slow at exactly the moment it matters. The rows arrive from PostGIS already
written as GeoJSON, so this only has to put commas between them.
