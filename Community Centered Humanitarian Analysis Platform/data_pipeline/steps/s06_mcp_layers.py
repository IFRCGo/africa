"""Step 6 of 7 - the external humanitarian layers, built FROM THE DATABASE.

This step used to read JSON files out of data_pipeline/mcp_cache/ and flatten them
into dashboard/data/. It no longer does. Everything it needs now lives in the
external_data tables, and the cache is only the staging area a pull lands in before
`manage.py load_external` puts it in the database.

What that changes in practice: the numbers on the dashboard and the numbers an
analyst queries in SQL are the same numbers, from the same rows, and a refresh is
"pull what source_sync says is missing, load it, run this step".

Outputs into dashboard/data/:
  crossings.json          border crossings tagged to movement corridors
  idp_localities.json     IDP locality bubbles + monthly series      (IOM-DTM)
  refugee_camps.json      host-country refugee totals + camp markers (UNHCR + Excel)
  ipc_areas_fs.geojson    Sudan's IPC snapshots over time            (IPC)
  ipc_fs/<ISO3>.geojson   the same, per country, for the rest        (IPC/CH)
  hsps.geojson            humanitarian service points, by district   (Kobo)
  seasonal.json           seasonal calendars, now one per country    (ACAPS)
  aoi_ipc.geojson         IFRC Areas of Interest + their IPC phase

WHY FOOD SECURITY IS SPLIT PER COUNTRY. One file carrying every country at every
period would be 13.9 MB - the data grew from one country to five, and each period
has to carry every country's then-current snapshot. ipc_areas_fs.geojson therefore
keeps its existing Sudan-only shape so the current dashboard is untouched, and the
per-country files beside it are what the multi-country map will load on demand.

    still the older file built by build_map_context, whose feature ids look like

    fills, and only the country-level wash - which is keyed on country name -
    still showing. That is exactly "I only see the country dimming".
