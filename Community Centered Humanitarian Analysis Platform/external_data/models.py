in a later migration, added with raw SQL, exactly as `admin_areas` does and for the
same reason: GeoDjango would mean putting GDAL into the web image for no capability
this project needs. Django is perfectly happy managing a table that has a column it
does not know about - it only ever names the columns it does.

    THE BOUNDARY LIBRARY IS STILL THE FIRST ANSWER. Almost every place a source

    point inside it. This table is the short list of places that are not units
    at all and never will be: Egypt's Qustul and Arkeen arrive in the Kobo
    service-point form under "Districts where these services are offered", but
    they are border reception points at the Sudan frontier. No p-code exists for
    either, so the name lookup in load_hsps.resolve_places could only ever leave
    them at lat=None - and a row with no coordinate is a row the dashboard does
    not draw.

    WHY A TABLE RATHER THAN A DICTIONARY IN THE LOADER. The coordinate has to
    outlive the rows it lands on. lat and lon are in load_hsps.UPDATE_FIELDS, so
    every load recomputes them, and a newer export writes new rows under a new
    date_reported with nothing in them at all. Putting the coordinate on the
    service-point row is therefore writing it in sand; putting it here is the
    same arrangement the other 129 rows already have, with this table standing
    in for admin_areas. It is also why this is the one table in
    external_data/admin.py that is editable: no loader writes it, so a corrected
    coordinate typed there is picked up by the next load_hsps and by nothing
    else. seed_external fills this table with get_or_create rather than
    update_or_create for the same reason - re-seeding must not undo a
    correction, or the list in that command would be the authority again.

    SOURCE, AND WHAT A ROW IS WORTH. 'curated' means a person entered it from
    operational geography and put their reasoning in `note`. These are site
    coordinates, not label positions - the opposite of what a row placed from a

    holds no service-point coordinates and no per-site rows: it is six submissions,
    one per country, recording which of eleven services the National Society offers
    and which districts it offers them in. A row here therefore means "this service
    is offered somewhere in this district", NOT "there is a service point at this
    spot". The lat/lon below is the district's own point-on-surface, taken from the
    boundary library, and is a label position rather than an address.

    That is the finest truthful placement the source supports, and saying so here
    is cheaper than someone later reading these dots as building locations.

    match_method='manual' IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it reads the other way round.
    A few of the form's "districts" are border reception points that no polygon
    carries - Egypt's Qustul and Arkeen are both crossings, not districts - so
    they can only be placed from a site coordinate a person entered. Those rows
    have a real point and no admin_pcode, and the coordinate comes from
    PlaceCoordinate above rather than from here: lat and lon are rewritten by
    every load, so a coordinate typed onto one of these rows would not survive
    the next one.

    South Sudan is the one country that answered "no" to "same services at every
    HSP", so it carries three named locations with their own service lists; those
    rows have scope='named-location'. The other five are country-wide.

    DATE_REPORTED IS THE EXPORT DATE, and there is no better one. The export
    carries no submission timestamp at all - Kobo's _submission__submission_time
    column is present but empty for every row - so the date comes from the export
    filename. It still does the job it is here for: load a later export and its
    rows sit beside these under a new date, so what changed is a query rather than
    a memory.
